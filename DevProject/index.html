    <title>PoweResume - restoring hiring power back to candidates</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to PoweResume</h1>
    <p>PoweResume aims to restore the balance of power back to candidates in the interview process. This is achieved by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the algorithyms that companies use to screen resumes against them to ensure that your resume is at, or near, the top of the pile reviewed</li>
      <li>Comparing your resume to the job description for the role that you are applying for and offering guidance on how to improve the symmetry between the two</li>
      <li>Offering guidance on salary expectations based on those who have held similar positions in your area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is one of my favorite websites: <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a></p>
